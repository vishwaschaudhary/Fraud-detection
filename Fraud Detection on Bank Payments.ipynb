    "## Fraud and detecting it\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraudulent behavior can be seen across many different fields such as e-commerce, healthcare, payment and banking systems. Fraud is a billion-dollar business and it is increasing every year. The PwC global economic crime survey of 2018 [1] found that half (49 percent) of the 7,200 companies they surveyed had experienced fraud of some kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if fraud seems to be scary for businesses it can be detected using intelligent systems such as rules engines or machine learning. Most people here in Kaggle are familier with machine learning but for rule engines here is a quick information. \n",
    "    A rules engine is a software system that executes one or more business rules in a runtime production environment. These rules are generally written by domain experts for transferring the knowledge of the problem to the rules engine and from there to production. Two rules examples for fraud detection would be limiting the number of transactions in a time period (velocity rules),  denying the transactions which come from previously known fraudulent IP's and/or domains.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Rules are great for detecting some type of frauds but they can fire a lot of false positives or false negatives in some cases because they have predefined threshold values. For example let's think of a rule for denying a transaction which has an amount that is bigger than 10000 dollars for a specific user. If this user is an experienced fraudster, he/she may be aware of the fact that the system would have a threshold and he/she can just make a transaction just below the threshold value (9999 dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "For these type of problems ML comes for help and reduce the risk of frauds and the risk of business to lose money. With the combination of rules and machine learning, detection of the fraud would be more precise and confident.\n",

    "**Fraud data** will be imbalanced like you see in the plot below and from the count of instances. To balance the dataset one can perform oversample or undersample techniques. Oversampling is increasing the number of the minority class by generating instances from the minority class . Undersampling is reducing the number of instances in the majority class by selecting random points from it to where it is equal with the minority class. Both operations have some risks: Oversample will create copies or similar data points which sometimes would not be helpful for the case of fraud detection because fraudulent transactions may vary. Undersampling means that we lost data points thus information. We will perform an oversampled technique called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). SMOTE will create new data points from minority class using the neighbour instances so generated samples are not exact copies but they are similar to instances we have."

Our accuracy would be almost 99 % for this dataset and mostly for others as well since fraud percentage is very low. Our accuracy is very high but we are not detecting any frauds so it is a useless classifier. So the base accuracy score should be better at least than predicting always non-fraudulent for performing a detection."
